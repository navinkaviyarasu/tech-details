### Wiring Guide
- Refer the below image of the Flywoo Goku GN405S AIO flight controller board's wiring diagram for wiring and integration

![](./SAFMC/assets/gn405s_wiring_diagram.png)

- Motors are wired in betaflight motor ordering. Refer the image below for reference.

![](./SAFMC/assets/betaflight -motor-ordering.jpeg)

- Wiring for serial communication between FC and OBC should be established as given below in the table

  |Flight Controller|On-Board Computer|
  |_________________|_________________|
  |       TX4       |  UART_AO_B_RX   |
  |       RX4       |  UART_AO_B_TX   |
  |       GND       |       GND       |
- OBC is powered from flight controller's +5V power out through USB-C port on OBC
- RC Rx is connected to the SBUS port of the FC
- Make sure you know what serial ports are available on the flight controller.
    Refer `boards/flywoo/f405s_aio/nuttx-config/include/board.h` in the [board firmware code](https://github.com/JohnTGZ/PX4-Autopilot) for Flywoo GN405S AIO board
  - UART 1 <-> /dev/ttyS0
    - UART 1 is used for communicating via USB
  - UART 2 <-> TEL1/101 (/dev/ttyS1)
  - UART 4 <-> TEL2/102 (/dev/ttyS2)
  - UART 6 <-> UART6 (/dev/ttyS3)

> Recommendation: 
>   It is recommended to use the capacitor (accompanied with the FC), as they help to reduce voltage spikes and electrical noise in the power system.

<!-- - These are some of the steps required to get the hardware set-up:
  - Need to solder red wire to 5V and black wire to GND and a USB C connector. Then heat shrink for final touch
  - The serial port pins (the three pins on the Radxa) need to be soldered onto the OBC (see Fig. \ref{obc}) -->

<!-- :::note 
Last time, the OBC was driven directly by the battery pack. However, now they are going to use the output tapping points of the flight controller to draw 5V to the OBC. (see Fig. \ref{pinout} which shows the 5V and GND pinout.).
::: -->

- Connecting RF receiver to the Flight Controller:
  - Refer to wiring diagram above and you can see some pinouts stating 4.5V, GND and SBUS. Solder the wires to a connector such that you can connect it to the RF receiver.
  - Then refer to the figure below and you can see how the wires should be connected to the connector. Once done, you can plug the RF receiver to the connector accordingly. 

<img src={rf_img} style={{width: 700}} />

- RC Tx & Rx Binding Procedure:
    - With that, you can set up the RC Transmitter (RC Tx)/Radio (in this case we are using the remote control as seen below) to pair with the RC Receiver (RC Rx).
    - Put the RC Tx into binding mode. Use to following settings on RC Tx (If using Frsky R-XSR RC Rx)

  ```yaml
  #Under SETUP Page

  Internal RF
    Mode      MULTI
    Type      FrskyX2
    Subtype   D16
  ```
    - Connect battery/power supply to the receiver while holding the F/S button on the RC Rx, the RED LED flashing indicates binding successfully
    - Reboot the RC Rx and go back to normal mode on RC Tx. GREEN LED constant on RC Rx indicates linking is normal
    - Refer to the RC Rx manual for more informations
  
  <!-- There is a button on the RF receiver which you can press. Press and hold it while you plug in the USB-b connector to the flight controller (F405). Then go to QGroundControl. -->

<!-- - There is also a need to check which channel the RF is communicating on (ie SBUS). There should be a blue light on the receiver if so. If not, there is a need to configure it to comms via SBUS. On the RF packaging there should be a manual. Look at the manual for more instructions.

- To check if the receiver is connected, go to QGroundControl and go to the radio tab to check if the flight controller responds to the control movements. -->

### Additional Information

#### Adding ESP32 Radio 

ESP32 is a radio that is faster than communicating via the TCP/IP protocol. It can be integrated with the flight controller board. One ESP32 radio will be attached to the Drone via serial port while the other will be attached to the ground laptop (USB port). In general, some code will be uploaded into the ESP32 board which allows it to transmit and receives messages continuously from its serial connection.

1. To start writing the code to be uploaded into the radio, you need have an arduino IDE and set up your IDE to work with ESP32 board (because it requires prerequisite packages like esp_now.h etc). Look here `https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/`.

2. Afterwhich, you can start writing the code to be uploaded. Some examples are as follows: `https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp-now-two-way-communication-esp32/`

3. For actual flight, you need to make sure the baud rate at which each radio is receiving and transmitting is the same (recommended 57600). For the ESP32 boards, this has to be configured in the code that you will upload to the board. For the drones, you have to configure it in the QGroundControl.Set baud rate telem2 to 57600 (or which ever baud rate to be consistent).

## 2. Flight Controller setup and configuration
<!-- We will need to:
1. Make sure PX4 parameters are set correctly.
2. Set up radio (Please set a killswitch)
3. Calibrate sensors (Done using QGroundControl)
4. Test motors (without propellers), make sure they are spinning in the right direction
    - IMPORTANT: If you are using a flywoo board with native support for betaflight, it is necessary to set the `MOT_ORDERING` param to 1.
5. Make sure that flight does not have significant vibrations. The default PID parameters should be good enough. Vibrations will lead to negative effects on motor health, EKF2 fusion etc. -->

### Updating ESC Firmware
  - Make sure to update the ESC firmware before flashing the PX4 Bootloader (i.e.) with native Betaflight bootloader
  - Connect the battery to the flight controller and connect the flight controller to the computer via USB
  - Use BLHeli Configurator to check and update the ESC firmware
    - [BLHeli Configurator Download Link](https://github.com/blheli-configurator/blheli-configurator/releases)
  - Reboot the flight controller 
  - Use Betaflight Configurator to check the motor directions. The motor directions (prop-in configuration) and numbering should be the same as indicated in the below image.
  ![](./SAFMC/assets/betaflight -motor-ordering.jpeg)
  - If the motor direction are not same as indicated in the image, note the motor number and use BLHeli Configurator to change the motor direction.

### PX4 Bootloader Flashing
:::note 
  - Since Flywoo GN405S doesn't have native PX4 support, PX4 bootloader has to be built and flashed.
  - Flywoo GN405S has similar architecture to the OmnibusF4SD board. Thus PX4 Bootloader for OmnibusF4SD can be utilized. 
:::
1. Clone the PX4 Bootloader repository and build the bootloader as below.
```
#Clone the PX4 Bootloader repository from github
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Bootloader.git
cd ./PX4-Bootloader
#Build the PX4 Bootloader for the OmnibusF4SD flight controller board
make omnibusf4sd_bl

```
>INFO: 
> If any python based error occurs, use `sudo apt install python-is-python2`.
> If any PX4 build error occurs, setup the PX4 developer environment using `Step 1` of Building and flashing PX4 firmware, and repeat the above procedure.
2. The build file should be available in `path_to/PX4-Bootloader/build/omnibusf4sd_bl`
3. Install the PX4 Bootloader using Betaflight configurator
  - Connect the flight controller to the computer using USB and start the Betaflight configurator
  - Click `Update Firmware` on the top right corner and click `Load Firmware [Local]` on the bottom right corner
  - Select the bootloader file (preferred `hex` file) from the system and flash the board
4. Reboot the system. Reconnect the flight controller to the computer and use the command on terminal `dmesg -w` to verify the connection [On Linux Computers]


### Building and flashing PX4 firmware
1. Set up the PX4 developer environment
```bash

# Clone the custom version of PX4 
git clone https://github.com/JohnTGZ/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive -b f405_aio_v1.13.0
# Run the ubuntu.sh with no arguments (in a bash shell) to install all dependencies
# Acknowledge any prompts as the script progress
bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh

```
2. Build the PX4 for you specific board
```bash

cd ./PX4-Autopilot
make <board_name>

```
  - The following list shows the build commands for the various Flywoo F405S flight controller models
    + Flywoo GOKU GN405S 20A AIO (ICM42688) : `flywoo_f405s_aio_icm42688p`
    + Flywoo GOKU GN405S 40A AIO (MPU600)   : `flywoo_f405s_aio_mpu6000`

```bash

#Example
cd ./PX4-Autopilot
make flywoo_f405s_aio_mpu6000

```

>INFO:
> Use `make list_config_targets` command on terminal to find the list of available board configurations

2. Flash the build firmware
    + Connect the flight controller to the computer and use the command below from PX4-Autopilot directory to flash the firmware
```bash

make <board_name> upload

```
    + Reboot the flight controller

### System setup and configuration using QGroundControl
1. Connect the flight controller to the computer 
2. Open QGrooundControl software, the drone should be detected automatically and connection should be established
3. Navigate to `App Menu(QGC Logo) --> Vehicle Setup`
4. Follow the list of setup options available under `Vehicle Setup` to configure your drone specific to your application
5. Example: Under `Airframe` setup option, select `Quadrotor X_Generic Quadrotor`, if you're planning to use Quadrotor X configuration.
6. Perform sensor calibration under `Sensors` setup option
7. If RC Tx & Rx Binding process was successful in above steps, perform the radio calibration under `Radio` setup option
8. Under `Flight Modes` setup option, setup the assign the required flight modes to you radio switch.
> IMPORTANT:
> It is mandatory to setup up `Emergency Kill switch channel`
9. Setup the battery parameters under `Power` setup option
10. Before using `Motors` setup option to check the motor directions. Make sure the parameter 'MOT_ORDERING' is set to `1` to use Betaflight motor ordering, as the Flywoo boards are native Betaflight flight controllers
> IMPORTANT:
> You are required to power up the drone using battery to check the motor directions.
> **Make sure propellers are not attached!**
11. Use `Safety` setup option to configure failsafe and safety features
12. You can use `Parameter` tab to configure any additional parameter specific to your project.
> INFO:
> Refer [PX4 Parameter Reference](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.html)
> Some parameters may be deprecated based on firmware versions, try changing `Version` on documentation page and look for parameters for more details
13. Perform a basic flight test to observe the vibrations and oscillation, and perform PID if required.

:::note 
  - If you are using pre-defined parameters loaded from saved file, update the parameter twice (i.e,.) upload the first time and reboot, upload the parameter the second time and reboot.
  - After parameters are all set, make sure to calibrate Gyro, Accel and Level under `Sensors`. Since you update the parameter from a pre-saved file, the calibration offset will be specific to that board, so it is mandatory to repeat the sensor calibration after parameter are loaded and saved.

## 3. On-Board Computer setup and configuration
Following are the steps to be followed to setup and configure the **Radxa Zero** OBC,
1. Remove auto-boot (i.e. Create an access point to the FCU)
2. Flashing of Ubuntu server image
3. Enable headless mode
4. Connecting to wifi network
5. Synchronization of time in isolated network (no internet connection)
6. Interfacing with PX4
7. Additional information. Important for debugging.

### 1. Remove autoboot (i.e. Create an access point to the FCU)
:::note
  This is only required if you are using GPIO Pin 8,10 and 11
:::
There's a need to create an access point by removing auto-boot from the radxa bootloader. When we power on the OBC, what the bootloader will usually do is that it will keep do a countdown and check for any disruption. So if we have the serial port of OBC connected to the flight controller, then there will be some input signal going to the serial port and hence it keeps disrupting the bootloading process. Therefore the OBC cannot boot up.

So the following instructions configures the bootloader to go into fastboot mode, which means don't do a count down and just immediately boot up. Which means you have to amend the config file to the bootloader.This bootloader is also stored in the eMMC. So how should we amend this config file? We have to clone the bootloader from the radxa github page, rebuild the binaries, ie `u-boot.bin` and then replace the u-boot.bin file in the eMMC (which is the `dd` step in the instruction).

- Install dependencies: 
    ```bash 

    sudo apt-get install -y wget bc nano mc build-essential autoconf libtool cmake pkg-config git python-dev swig libpcre3-dev libnode-dev gawk wget diffstat bison flex device-tree-compiler libncurses5-dev gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu binfmt-support binfmt-support qemu-user-static gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf fastboot

    ```
- Git clone 2 packages
    ```bash

    git clone  --branch radxa-zero-v2021.07 https://github.com/radxa/u-boot.git
    git clone https://github.com/radxa/fip.git

    ```
- Edit the radxa zero config in the u-boot repo
    ```bash

    nano u-boot/configs/radxa-zero_defconfig
    #Add **CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=-2** before **#CONFIG_DISPLAY_CPUINFO is not set**

    ```
- Compile from `u-boot`
    ```bash

    cd u-boot
    export ARCH=arm
    export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
    make radxa-zero_defconfig
    make

    ```
- Compile from `fip/radxa-zero`
    ```bash

    cp u-boot.bin ../fip/radxa-zero/bl33.bin
    cd ../fip/radxa-zero
    make

    ```
- Copy u-boot.bin over
    - Sideload (Safer option) 
        - Hold down boot button on radxa and connect to PC, then run:
            ```bash
            
            sudo boot-g12.py /path/to/fip/radxa-zero/u-boot.bin

            ```
    - (ONLY AS LAST RESORT) Use dd to write over the eMMC
        - Hold down boot button on radxa and connect to PC. Run the following command to expose the Radxa as a mountable disk
            ```bash
            
            sudo boot-g12.py rz-udisk-loader.bin
            
            ``` 
        - Use `dmesg/lsblk` to figure out what `sdX` is Radxa
        - In fip/radxa-zero, run the following command to copy the files over
        ```bash 
        sudo dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=512 seek=1
        
        ```
- Reboot the device

### 2. Flashing of Ubuntu Server image
Here, we focus on flashing the Ubuntu OS into the OBC via eMMC. eMMC is like a non-volatile storage device. There is also another way of flashing using microSD card. An introduction is listed here: `https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/getting_started`.

1. Install the following tools on your main computer:
    ```bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install pyamlboot

    ```

2. Erase eMMC of Radxa
    - Press down boot button on Radxa before powering it on and connecting it to the PC. NOTE: Button must be pressed down WHILE physically connecting it via USB to the computer.
    - Download `radxa-zero-erase-emmc.bin` AND `rz-udisk-loader.bin`
    - Run `sudo boot-g12.py radxa-zero-erase-emmc.bin`
        - This will automatically erase eMMC, then present eMMC as a USB storage device.
    - [Reference](https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/install/eMMC_erase)

3. Install [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher)

4. Flash Ubuntu OS onto Radxa
    - Download images from [here](https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/downloads), the file name should be something like `radxa-zero-ubuntu-focal-server-arm64-XXX-mbr.img`
    - Decompress images using `xz -v --decompress IMAGE_COMPRESSED`
    - Use BalenaEtcher to mount the image. After step 2 (erasing the eMMC), the radxa eMMC should appear as a flashable device

Once the OBC is flashed, then when you power on the OBC, it will now run the Ubuntu OS. To start up Radxa standalone, you need to:

1. Plug in the power port from an external power supply
2. Connect the keyboard 
3. Connect micro HDMI from the OBC to a monitor
4. Once started up, username and password are 'rock'

### 3. Enable headless mode
Disable debug port on OBC. This is so that the Flight controller unit can communicate with the radxa. Edit `/boot/uEnv.txt` and remove line with `console=ttyAML0,115200`, which removes this port as a debugging console.

### 4. Connecting to wifi network
```bash

# Proceed on activating WIFI using https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/Ubuntu
# Root username and pasword is rock/rock
sudo su
sudo nmcli r wifi on
sudo nmcli dev wifi
sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "wifi_name" password "wifi_password"       

```
Optionally, you can set network priorities to prioritize which network to connect to:
```bash

# List priority table
nmcli -f NAME,UUID,AUTOCONNECT,AUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY c
# Set priority of WIFINAME network
nmcli connection modify WIFINAME connection.autoconnect-priority 10

```

### 5. Synchronization of time in isolated network (no internet connection)
There will be situations where your local network does not have internet but you will need to maintain time synchronization across the devices within the same network especially when operating ROS. 

The following instruction goes through how to set up a NTP (Network Time Protocol) server on your host computer and NTP clients on your radxa devices (or any other linux device for that matter).

- Make sure ntp daemon is installed on both host and client computer: `sudo apt-get install ntp`
- (Optional) Add network aliases to /etc/hosts

- Host computer
  1. modify the ntp config: `sudo vim /etc/ntp.conf` and add the following lines
    ```bash

      # Add local clock as server in the event there is no internet connection
      server 127.127.1.0
      # fudge forces the system to treat local clock as a ntp server
      fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
      # Restrict access to only within the local network subnet
      restrict 192.168.31.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

    ```
  2. Restart ntp: `sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart`
  3. Monitor system log to see if you can synchronize with a time server: `tail -f /var/log/syslog`

- Client computer
  1. modify the ntp config: `sudo vim /etc/ntp.conf` and add the following lines
    ```bash
    
      # Add the local ntp server as a master, please DO NOT ever add 'prefer' keyword, it will not work
      server master0 iburst

    ```
  2. Restart ntp: `sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart`
  3. Monitor connections to peer: `ntpq -c lpeer`

- More commands for ntp
  ```bash

    #####
    # ntp
    #####
    # Restart ntp server
    sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart

    # Check for synchronization 
    tail -f /var/log/syslog

    # Check list of peers
    ntpq -c lpeer

    # systemctl
    systemctl status chronyd
    sudo systemctl restart chronyd
    
    # timedatectl
    timedatectl status

### 6. Interface with PX4
- Make sure you have already enabled headless mode in Step 3
>INFO:
> Connection between FCU and Radxa
>   - FCU: Connected as MAV_0_CONFIG to one of the UART (should be UART4, which is registered as TEL2 in PX4)
>   - Radxa: Connected to UART_AO_B (/dev/ttyAML1)
- Make sure your current user (on Radxa) is added to the dialout group through `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
  - If not, you will meet a `permission denied` error when trying to access the serial port
- Edit '/boot/uEnv.txt' to set UART_AO_B as common serial communication devices(GPIO PIN 7 and 11) for UART functionality, for serial communication between FC & OBC
```yaml

#Change the overlay as below
overlays=meson-g12a-uart-ao-b-on-gpioao-2-gpioao-3

```
- Reboot the OBC
- Launch mavros bridge
    - Might need to perform the following in root mode. Enter with `sudo su`
    - `source /home/rock/.bashrc`
    - `roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=/dev/ttyAML1:230400`
- A successful connection should show you that an IMU is detected from the node and you should be able to rostopic echo the current drone's position

#### How to startup Radxa terminal on Your Laptop/Desktop's OS

Because Radxa has no GUI, it might be better to run the Radxa's terminal on top of an existing desktop OS like Ubuntu. So that you can copy and paste and browse the web. So what you need is the following:

1. You need to connect the serial debug port on the Radxa to a USB for communication with the desktop. (Don't connect the power supply to the board yet).
2. Download minicom, which is a software that can be used to communicate with Radxa through serial port. see `https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/dev/serial-console`. In general the steps are:
  2.1 Add current user to the plugdev group so that can access serial device without root permission.
  2.2 Then edit bashrc with alias minicom and default settings
  2.3 Run the command 'minicom zero'
  2.4 After running, you can press Crtl+X and then followed by z to set configurations.
```bash
# Download Minicom
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install minicom
#First let's add the current user to plugdev group so we can access serial device without root permission.
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
# Edit your ~/.bashrc and add the following line so minicom will always be launched with the following default setting
alias minicom='minicom -w -t xterm -l -R UTF-8'

#Login to a new terminal to for the change to take effect.
#Create and edit file ~/.minirc.zero with the following content:
pu port             /dev/ttyUSB0
pu baudrate         115200
pu bits             8
pu parity           N
pu stopbits         1
pu rtscts           No

#Now executing minicom zero will use the config above, and connect to Radxa Zero's serial console.
```
3. With the above steps, you can then plug in your power supply to power up the OBC. Minicom should be able to auto detect the OBC and display the OBC's terminal on the terminal that you ran Minicom.
4. So in a way this feels like an SSH. You can now control the OBC from your existing main OS.

#### Clone your Radxa device as an image
```bash

# Hold boot button and connect radxa to pc, run the following command
sudo boot-g12.py rz-udisk-loader.bin

# Get device name, should be something like "/dev/sdX" where X is a letter
lsblk -p

# Copy device image
export SD_CARD_DEVICE_NAME=/dev/sdX
export IMAGE_FILE_NAME=~/Downloads/gestelt_os_15_8_23.img

sudo dd bs=4M if=$SD_CARD_DEVICE_NAME of=$IMAGE_FILE_NAME conv=fsync status=progress
sudo chown $USER: $IMAGE_FILE_NAME

# Installation of PiShrink
cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drewsif/PiShrink/master/pishrink.sh
chmod +x pishrink.sh
sudo mv pishrink.sh /usr/local/sbin/pishrink
sudo pishrink $IMAGE_FILE_NAME

# Compress image if necessary 
tar -czf $IMAGE_NAME.tar.gz $IMAGE_NAME.img

# Proceed to load image onto board using BalenaEtcher or other methods

```

#### ssh into Radxa
```bash

# Get RADXA_IP_ADDR from ifconfig on the radxa device
ssh rock@RADXA_IP

```

(OPTIONAL) Generate ssh keys to make your life easier
```bash
# On central computer, generate a public key
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
# Copy public key over to robot
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa rock@ROBOT_IP
```
On central computer, setup ssh config file. Save as `~/.ssh/config`
```bash

Host robot
    User rock
    Hostname ROBOT_IP
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
    ForwardX11 yes

```
Now you can access the Radxa using `ssh robot`

### Troubleshooting
1. Permission denied when accessing serial port of FCU from MAVROS on Radxa
    - Make sure Baud rate when launching MAVROS matches what is set as PX4 params
    - Make sure your current user (on Radxa) is added to the dialout group through `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER`
2. Unable to boot up Radxa.
  - Did you miss out on any installation steps?
  - If not, proceed to reflash the bootloader. This is done by pressing the boot button on radxa and connecting it to the PC. You would then run the following command: `sudo boot-g12.py /path/to/fip/radxa-zero/u-boot.bin`
